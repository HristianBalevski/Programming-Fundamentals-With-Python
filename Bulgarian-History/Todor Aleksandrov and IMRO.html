<h1><b>TODOR ALEKSANDROV AND IMRO</b></h1>
  <p>Todor Aleksandrov Poprusev was born on March 4, 1881 in Novo Selo - neighborhood of the city of Stip.<br>
    In 1898, at the age of 17, he enters the ranks of IMRO. After the Ilinden Uprising (1903) of january 1905,<br>
    he was made district leader in the Skopje area. Since 1911, he was a member of the Central Committee(HQ)<br>
    of VMRO.<br>
    <br>He was actively involved in the Balkan War from 1912-1913 and the World War from 1915-1918, with<br>
    the organization of detachments and troops, who fought alongside the Bulgarian Army.<br>
    <br>
    By 1922, the organization is dealing with rampant delinquency in Pirin Macedonia and in fact, VMRO becomes<br>
    a "state in a state". After 1920 under his leadership, IMRO resumed its revolutionary activities in Vardar<br>
    and Aegean Macedonia. Todor Aleksandrov becomes an insurmountable factor in the politics of Bulgaria<br>
    and The Balkans. Even during the course of his lifetime, Encyclopedia Britannica calls him "the uncrowned king<br>
    of the bulgarians in Macedonia."<br>
    <br>
     On August 31, 1924 Todor Aleksandrov was killed in the Pirin Mountainon the site called Flat Beech ("Ravna Buka").<br>
     The management of the organization decided to bury him here, in the chapel of St.Elias.<br>
