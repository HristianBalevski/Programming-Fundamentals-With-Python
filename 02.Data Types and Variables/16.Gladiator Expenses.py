#As a gladiator, Peter needs to repair his broken equipment when he loses a fight. His equipment consists of a helmet, a sword, a shield, and an armor. 
#You will receive Peter's lost fights count.
#Every second lost game, his helmet is broken.
#Every third lost game, his sword is broken.
#When both his sword and helmet are broken in the same lost fight, his shield also breaks.
#Every second time his shield brakes, his armor also needs to be repaired.
#You will receive the price of each item in his equipment. Calculate his expenses for the year for renewing his equipment.
