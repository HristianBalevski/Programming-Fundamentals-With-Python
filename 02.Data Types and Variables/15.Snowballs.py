#You will receive N â€“ an integer, the number of snowballs being made by Tony and Andi.On the following lines, you will receive 3 inputs for each snowball:
#The weight of the snowball (integer).
#The time needed for the snowball to get to its target (integer).
#The quality of the snowball (integer)
#For each snowball, you must calculate its value by the following formula:
#(snowball_weight / snowball_time) ** snowball_quality
#In the end, you must print the highest calculated value of a snowball.
